# Introduction to Differential Equations (Notes)

## Key Points
- ODEs involve one independent variable.
- Used to model systems involving rates of change.

## Order and Form
- Order = highest derivative.
- General nth order:
$$
F(t, u, u', \ldots, u^{(n)}) = 0
$$

- Normal form:
$$
u^{(n)} = g(t, u, u', \ldots, u^{(n-1)})
$$

## Linear vs Nonlinear
- Linear if equation is linear in u and derivatives.
- Nonlinear equations may require qualitative or numerical methods.

## Examples
- Exponential growth: $u' = \alpha u$
- Free fall: $u'' = g$
- Damped fall: $u'' = g - \alpha u'$

## Initial Value Problem
Given:
$$
u(t_0) = u_0
$$
Solution must satisfy both the ODE and the initial condition.

## Reminder
Nonlinear ODEs often have no closed form solutions.  
Qualitative theorems become essential.
