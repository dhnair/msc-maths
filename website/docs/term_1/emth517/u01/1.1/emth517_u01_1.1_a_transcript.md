# Introduction to Differential Equations (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
After this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand why differential equations are used in modeling.
- Identify order and normal form of an ODE.
- Recognize linear and nonlinear equations.
- Understand initial value problems.

## 1. Motivation
Many physical, biological, and engineering systems involve rates of change.  
Differential equations capture these relationships using:
- independent variable t  
- dependent variable u(t)  
- derivatives u'(t), u''(t), and so on  

## 2. Examples
1. Population growth:
$$
u'(t) = \alpha u(t), \quad \alpha > 0
$$

2. Free fall:
$$
m u''(t) = m g
$$

3. Falling with air resistance:
$$
m u''(t) = m g - \alpha u'(t)
$$

## 3. Order and Form
An nth order ODE has the form:
$$
F(t, u, u', u'', \ldots, u^{(n)}) = 0
$$

If it can be written as:
$$
u^{(n)} = g(t, u, u', \ldots, u^{(n-1)})
$$
it is said to be in normal form.

## 4. Implicit to Explicit Example
Consider the implicit equation:
$$
u'^3 - 3 t^2 u'^2 + 3 u u' = 0
$$

Factoring gives:
$$
u' = 0
$$
or
$$
u' = \frac{3 t^2 \pm \sqrt{9 t^4 - 12 u}}{2}
$$

## 5. Linear vs Nonlinear
A first order ODE,
$$
u' = g(t,u)
$$
is linear if g(t,u) is linear in u.  
Otherwise it is nonlinear.

Example linear ODE:
$$
u' = t u + 2 t
$$
Its general solution is:
$$
u(t) = c e^{t^2 / 2} - 2
$$

## 6. Initial Value Problem (IVP)
An IVP consists of an ODE and an initial condition:
$$
u(t_0) = u_0
$$

A function u(t) solves the IVP if:
- it is differentiable,
- satisfies the ODE,
- satisfies the initial condition,
- remains inside the domain of definition.

## Summary
Differential equations describe systems where change is essential.  
This lecture introduced order, form, linearity, and initial value problems.
