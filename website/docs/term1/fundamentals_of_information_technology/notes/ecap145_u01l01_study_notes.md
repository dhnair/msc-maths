# ECAP145 - U01L01 Quick Revision Notes

## Key Concepts
- **Computer**: Electronic device for high-speed data processing.
- **Data Processing**: Raw data → Processing → Meaningful Information.

## Characteristics
- Automatic
- High Speed (micro/nano/picoseconds)
- Accuracy (errors due to wrong input)
- Diligence (no tiredness)
- Versatility (multitasking)
- Memory Power (store/recall huge data)
