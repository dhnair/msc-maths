# Meaning of Research (*Notes*)

## Core Ideas
- Research = systematic, scientific investigation.
- Seeks **new knowledge**, not just information.
- Moves from **known → unknown**.

## Key Definitions
- **Information**: existing facts accessible from external sources.
- **Knowledge**: insight obtained through investigation.
- **Hypothesis**: testable proposition or tentative explanation.

## Characteristics of Good Research
- Systematic  
- Logical  
- Empirical  
- Replicable  
- Critical  

## Research Process (Simplified)
1. Identify & define the problem.  
2. Review literature.  
3. Form hypotheses.  
4. Select methodology & sampling.  
5. Collect data.  
6. Analyse data.  
7. Draw conclusions & verify with hypothesis.

## Quick Example
Studying railway delays:  
Hypothesis — “Maintenance schedule affects delay frequency.”  
Data — historical logs.  
Analysis — correlation, patterns.  

## Exam Tip
Always distinguish **research method** (tools/techniques) from **methodology** (overall design and logic of inquiry).
