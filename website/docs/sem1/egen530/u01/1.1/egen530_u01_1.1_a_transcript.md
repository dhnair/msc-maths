# Meaning of Research (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
After this lecture, you will be able to:
- Explain the meaning of research.
- Distinguish information from knowledge.
- Understand the role of hypothesis, data, and analysis.
- Recognize characteristics of good research.

## 1. Introduction
Research is a systematic and scientific investigation that aims to discover new knowledge.  
It is not merely collecting information. Information is what already exists.  
Knowledge is what we obtain after critical, structured inquiry.

## 2. Meaning of Research
Research is a scientific and systematic search for relevant information on a specific topic.  
A typical research process involves:
- Defining and redefining the problem.
- Reviewing earlier literature.
- Formulating hypotheses.
- Designing methods and sampling.
- Collecting data.
- Analyzing and interpreting results.
- Testing conclusions.

## 3. Information vs Knowledge
Information may come from books, reports, or online sources.  
Knowledge is obtained when a researcher interprets evidence through a structured method.

## 4. Characteristics of Good Research
Good research is:
- Systematic
- Logical
- Empirical
- Replicable
- Critical

## 5. Hypothesis and Data
A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that can be tested.  
Example hypothesis: "Younger adults prefer fresh fruit juice more than older adults."

Data collection must follow a chosen methodology such as surveys, experiments, or observations.  
Analysis is used to test the hypothesis objectively.

## 6. Research as Fact-Finding
Research moves from the known to the unknown.  
It attempts to provide answers to questions that have not yet been resolved.

## Summary
Research is a deliberate, logical, and scientific process of discovering new knowledge.  
It plays a crucial role in academic inquiry and real-world problem solving.
