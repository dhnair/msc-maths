# Meaning of Research (*Transcript*)

## Learning Outcomes
After this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand the academic meaning of “research”.
- Distinguish *information* from *knowledge*.
- Recognize the role of creativity and systematic inquiry.
- Describe key characteristics of good research.
- Explain how hypotheses, data collection, and analysis fit into the research cycle.

## 1. Introduction
Research is more than searching — it is *re-search*, a renewed attempt to uncover what is not yet understood.  
In academic usage, research refers to a **systematic and scientific investigation** aimed at discovering new knowledge, validating existing ideas, or solving a problem.

Research differs from everyday information gathering.  
- **Information** is what already exists.  
- **Knowledge** is what we *derive* through disciplined investigation.

## 2. Meaning of Research
At its core, research is a structured attempt to understand reality.  
A standard definition can be summarized as:

> “Research is a scientific and systematic search for pertinent information on a specific topic.”

This involves:
- Defining and redefining a problem.
- Reviewing earlier work.
- Formulating hypotheses.
- Designing methods.
- Gathering data.
- Analysing and interpreting results.
- Reaching and testing conclusions.

## 3. Characteristics of Research
Good research has certain traits:
- **Systematic** – follows a sequence of logical steps.
- **Logical** – guided by reasoning.
- **Empirical** – conclusions are based on observations.
- **Replicable** – results can be checked by others.
- **Critical** – involves careful and objective judgment.

## 4. Art and Science of Inquiry
Although research uses scientific methods, it also demands human traits:
- Curiosity  
- Creativity  
- Critical thinking  
- Awareness of bias  

A researcher must interpret, question, and refine ideas continually.

## 5. Hypothesis and Data
A **hypothesis** is a tentative explanation or proposition that can be tested.  
Example: “Fresh fruit juice is preferred more by younger adults than older adults.”

Data collection must follow the chosen methodology — surveys, observations, experiments, or secondary datasets.  
This data is then organised, analysed, and evaluated to confirm or refute the hypothesis.

## 6. Research as a Fact‑Finding Process
Research moves “from the known to the unknown.”  
It transforms ambiguous questions into structured inquiry.  
Every stage — from literature review to data analysis — contributes toward new knowledge or validation of existing knowledge.

## Summary
Research is the deliberate, logical, scientific, and creative process of discovering knowledge. It aims at:
- understanding problems,
- generating solutions,
- expanding human understanding.
