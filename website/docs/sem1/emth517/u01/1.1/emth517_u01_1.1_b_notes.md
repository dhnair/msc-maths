# Introduction to Differential Equations (*Notes*)

## Key Points
- Differential equations model systems involving **rates of change**.
- ODE: equation with one independent variable.

## Order & Form
- Order = highest derivative.
- General nth‑order form:  
  $$F(t,u,u',...,u^{(n)}) = 0.$$
- Normal form:  
  $$u^{(n)} = g(t,u,u',...,u^{(n-1)}).$$

## Linear vs Nonlinear
- Linear if equation is linear in \(u\) and its derivatives.
- Nonlinear equations may not have closed‑form solutions.

## Examples
- \(u'=lpha u\): exponential growth.  
- \(u''=g\): free fall.  
- \(u''=g-lpha u'\): damping.

## IVP (Initial Value Problem)
Given:
- ODE  
- Condition \(u(t_0)=u_0\)

Solution must:
- satisfy ODE  
- satisfy initial condition  
- remain well‑defined on an interval  

## Quick Reminder
Nonlinear ODEs often require **qualitative** tools such as uniqueness theorems, inequalities, and stability theory.
