# Introduction to Differential Equations (*Transcript*)

## Learning Outcomes
After this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand the motivation for differential equations in modelling.
- Identify order and type of ODEs.
- Convert implicit differential equations into normal form.
- Recognize the notion of solutions and initial value problems.

## 1. Why Differential Equations?
Many laws of nature relate quantities with their **rates of change**.  
Population growth, falling bodies, circuits, chemical reactions, and heat flow all obey relations involving derivatives.

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) captures such relations using:
- an independent variable (usually time \(t\))
- a dependent variable \(u(t)\)
- derivatives \(u', u'', \ldots\)

## 2. Basic Examples
1. Population growth:  
   $$u'(t) = lpha u(t),\quad lpha>0.$$

2. Free fall:  
   $$m u''(t) = mg.$$

3. Falling with air resistance:  
   $$m u''(t) = mg - lpha u'(t).$$

These show how real systems are translated into ODEs.

## 3. Order and Form of ODEs
The **order** is the highest derivative present.

A general nth‑order ODE is:
$$F(t, u, u', u'', \ldots, u^{(n)}) = 0.$$

If it can be solved for the highest derivative:
$$u^{(n)} = g(t, u, u', \ldots, u^{(n-1)}),$$
it is said to be in **normal form**.

## 4. Implicit → Explicit Example
Equation:
$$ u'^3 - 3t^2 u'^2 + 3u u' = 0. $$

Factoring yields three first‑order equations:
\[
u' = 0,\qquad
u' = rac{3t^2 \pm \sqrt{9t^4 - 12u}}{2}.
\]

This illustrates why implicit equations may represent *multiple* ODEs.

## 5. Linear vs Nonlinear
A first‑order equation  
$$u' = g(t,u)$$  
is **linear** if \(g(t,u)\) is linear in \(u\).  
Otherwise it is **nonlinear**.

Linear equations have systematic solution methods; nonlinear ones often require qualitative or numerical techniques.

## 6. General & Particular Solutions
A **general solution** captures all possible integral curves.  
A **particular solution** satisfies a specific condition.

Example:  
For  
$$u' = t u + 2t,$$  
the general solution is  
$$u(t) = c e^{t^2/2} - 2.$$

## 7. Initial Value Problem (IVP)
An ODE becomes an IVP when equipped with:
\[
u(t_0) = u_0.
\]

A function \(u(t)\) is a solution to the IVP if:
- it is differentiable,
- satisfies the ODE,
- satisfies the initial condition,
- and its graph remains in the domain of definition.

Much of EMTH517 studies existence, uniqueness, and behaviour of such solutions.

## Summary
Differential equations are the language of dynamical systems.  
This lecture introduced their form, interpretation, and the role of initial conditions.  
Subsequent units develop existence theorems, inequalities, and qualitative theory.
