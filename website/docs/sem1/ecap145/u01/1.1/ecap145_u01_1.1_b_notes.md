# Characteristics and Generations of Computers (*Notes*)

## Key Concepts
- **Computer**: Electronic device for high-speed data processing.
- **Data Processing**: Raw data → Processing → Meaningful Information.

## Characteristics
- Automatic
- High Speed (micro/nano/picoseconds)
- Accuracy (errors due to wrong input)
- Diligence (no tiredness)
- Versatility (multitasking)
- Memory Power (store/recall huge data)
- No IQ (only follows instructions)
- No Feelings (no emotions)
- Productivity Enhancement

## Evolution
- **Mechanical Era (1623–1945)**: Pascaline, Leibniz calculator, punch cards, Babbage’s engines.

## Generations
1. **First Gen**: Vacuum tubes, room-sized, machine language (ENIAC, UNIVAC).
2. **Second Gen**: Transistors, smaller, faster, FORTRAN, COBOL (CDC 6600).
3. **Third Gen**: ICs, cheaper, reliable, monitors/keyboards, BASIC.
4. **Fourth Gen**: Microprocessors (Intel 4004), GUI, advanced software.
5. **Fifth Gen**: AI, robotics, smartphones, voice assistants (Siri, Cortana).

## Benefits
- Large storage, paperless.
- Sorting & searching files.
- Productivity boost (cloud, software).
- Internet connectivity & business use.
- Learning enhancement (MOOCs).
- Saves time, helps make money.
