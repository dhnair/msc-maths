# Characteristics and Generations of Computers (*Transcript*)

## Introduction
After this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of computers
- Define data processing
- Explore the evolution of computers
- Learn about the different generations of computers

## What is a Computer?
- The word "computer" comes from "compute," meaning "to calculate".
- A computer is an electronic device that performs arithmetic and logical operations at high speed.
- It is also called a data processor since it can store, process, and retrieve data as needed.

## Data Processing
- Subset of information processing using a computer system.
- Involves collection, manipulation, and transformation of raw data into meaningful information.
- Stages of data processing:
  1. Data Collection (from surveys, networks, social media, forms, etc.)
  2. Data Storage (internal memory, external devices)
  3. Sorting (arranging data meaningfully)
  4. Processing (performing operations on the data)
  5. Analysis (extracting meaningful information)
  6. Presentation (final organized information for the user)

## Characteristics of Computers
1. **Automatic** – work without human intervention once programmed.
2. **High Speed** – operations measured in microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds.
3. **Accuracy** – highly accurate results, errors usually due to wrong input or faulty programs.
4. **Diligence** – no tiredness, monotony, or lack of concentration.
5. **Versatility** – multitasking and capable of handling varied tasks.
6. **Power of Remembrance** – store and recall huge amounts of data.
7. **No IQ** – programmable, no self-intelligence, decisions based on instructions.
8. **No Feelings** – devoid of emotions, follow instructions strictly.
9. **Productivity Enhancement** – improves efficiency once software/tools are learned.

## Evolution of Computers
- **Mechanical Era (1623–1945)**
  - Used mechanical components like levers and gears.
  - Key inventions:
    - Pascaline (1642, Blaise Pascal) – mechanical adding machine.
    - Leibniz Calculator (1671–1694) – could add, subtract, multiply, divide.
    - Herman Hollerith’s punch cards (1880s).
    - Charles Babbage (1822) – Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. Known as the "Father of Modern Computers".

## Generations of Computers
1. **First Generation (1940s–1950s)**
   - Based on vacuum tubes.
   - Very large in size (occupied whole rooms).
   - No operating systems, machine-specific languages.
   - Examples: ENIAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC.
2. **Second Generation (1950s–1960s)**
   - Based on transistors (smaller, faster, more reliable, energy efficient).
   - Supported scientific and business applications.
   - Programming languages introduced: FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959).
   - Example: CDC 6600 (first supercomputer).
3. **Third Generation (1960s–1970s)**
   - Used Integrated Circuits (ICs).
   - Faster, smaller, cheaper, more reliable.
   - Introduced monitors, keyboards, networking concepts.
   - Programming language BASIC developed.
4. **Fourth Generation (1970s–1980s)**
   - Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), microprocessors (e.g., Intel 4004).
   - Smaller, cheaper, more powerful.
   - GUI (Graphical User Interface), advanced I/O devices, software expansion.
5. **Fifth Generation (1980s–present)**
   - Super Large Scale Integration (SLSI), artificial intelligence, robotics.
   - Includes smartphones, smart TVs, handheld devices.
   - Features: voice recognition (Siri, Cortana), huge storage, multiple CPUs.

## Benefits of Computers
- Large storage and reduced waste (paperless environment).
- Sorting, sharing, organizing, and quick searching of information.
- Better understanding of data (business analytics, Excel).
- Increased productivity (cloud computing, remote work).
- Connectivity (internet, decision support systems, social networks).
- Source of income (ads, content creation).
- Time-saving (fast execution of tasks).
- Enhanced learning (MOOCs, e-learning).
