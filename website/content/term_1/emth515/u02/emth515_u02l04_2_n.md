# U02L04 – Refinement-Based Characterizations (Notes)

## Key Result
If  
- \(f\) bounded on \([a,b]\),  
- \(f\) has finitely many discontinuities,  
- \(\alpha\) monotone and continuous at those points,  

then  
\[
f \in R(\alpha).
\]

## Strategy
1. Identify discontinuities \(y_1,\dots,y_p\).
2. By continuity of \(\alpha\), choose small intervals \((u_i,v_i)\) covering each \(y_i\) with:
   \[
   \sum (lpha(v_i)-lpha(u_i)) < rac{\epsilon}{2(M-m)}.
   \]
3. On each discontinuity interval:
   \[
   M_i - m_i \le M - m \Rightarrow
   \sum (M_i - m_i)\Deltalpha_i < \epsilon/2.
   \]
4. On the remaining \(p+1\) intervals, \(f\) is continuous → RS integrable.
5. Choose a partition containing all endpoints:
   \[
   U(P,f,lpha) - L(P,f,lpha) < \epsilon.
   \]

## Example
For the point-discontinuous function  
\[
f(x) = \mathbf{1}_{\{x_0\}},
\]
if \(\alpha\) is continuous at \(x_0\):
- Lower sums = 0.
- Upper sums → 0.
Thus  
\[
\int_a^b f\, dlpha = 0.
\]

## Summary
- Finitely many discontinuities do not obstruct integrability.
- Continuity of \(\alpha\) at the discontinuities is essential.
- Construction of adapted partitions shows \(U-L\) can be made arbitrarily small.
