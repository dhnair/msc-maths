# U02L06 – Functions of Bounded Variation (Notes)

## Key Result
If:
- \( lpha \) increasing,
- \( lpha' \) Riemann integrable,
- \( f \) bounded,

then:
\[
f\in R(lpha)
\iff
flpha'\in R,
\]
and
\[
\int_a^b f\, dlpha = \int_a^b f(x)lpha'(x)\, dx.
\]

## Core Ideas
- Mean Value Theorem gives
  \[
  \Deltalpha_i = lpha'(t_i)\Delta x_i.
  \]
- RS sum becomes:
  \[
  S(P,f,lpha) = S(P,flpha').
  \]
- Integrability transfers because differences between RS and Riemann sums are arbitrarily small.

## Important Expressions
- RS sum:
  \[
  \sum f(t_i)\Deltalpha_i.
  \]
- Riemann sum:
  \[
  \sum f(t_i)lpha'(t_i)\Delta x_i.
  \]
- Inequality:
  \[
  |U(P,f,lpha) - U(P,flpha')| < karepsilon.
  \]

## Summary
This lecture shows that when \( lpha' \) exists and is integrable, the RS integral becomes a weighted Riemann integral. The equivalence of integrability simplifies analysis and calculation.
