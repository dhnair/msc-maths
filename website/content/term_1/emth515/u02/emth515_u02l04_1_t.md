# U02L04 – Refinement-Based Characterizations (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply refinement arguments to characterize RS integrability.
- Understand integrability when \(f\) has finitely many discontinuities.
- Use continuity of the integrator \(\alpha\) at points of discontinuity of \(f\).
- Construct partitions isolating discontinuities to control upper–lower sum gaps.

## Introduction
This lecture proves a key theorem:  
If \(f\) is bounded on \([a,b]\) and has finitely many discontinuities \(y_1,\dots,y_p\), and if \(\alpha\) is monotonically increasing and continuous at each \(y_i\), then  
\[
f \in R(\alpha) 	ext{ on } [a,b].
\]

## Setup
- Let \(E = \{y_1,\dots,y_p\}\), the finite set of discontinuities of \(f\).
- \(\alpha\) is continuous at each point of \(E\).
- Cover each \(y_i\) with a small interval \((u_i, v_i)\) such that:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^p \left( \alpha(v_i) - \alpha(u_i) \right)
  < \frac{\epsilon}{2(M - m)},
  \]
  where \(m, M\) are global bounds of \(f\).

This choice is possible due to continuity of \(\alpha\) at each \(y_i\).

## Bounds on Discontinuity Intervals
For each interval \((u_i, v_i)\):
- Let \(m_i, M_i\) be the bounds of \(f\) there.
- Since \(m \le m_i \le M_i \le M\):
  \[
  M_i - m_i \le M - m.
  \]
Multiply by \(\Delta \alpha_i = \alpha(v_i) - \alpha(u_i)\) and sum:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^p (M_i - m_i)\Delta \alpha_i
< rac{\epsilon}{2}.
\]

## Remaining Subintervals
Removing all \((u_i,v_i)\) leaves \(p+1\) intervals where \(f\) is continuous.  
Since \(f\) is continuous and \(\alpha\) is monotone,  
\[
f \in R(\alpha) 	ext{ on each remaining interval.}
\]

Thus for each such interval the gap satisfies:
\[
U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
\]
for sufficiently fine partitions.

## Constructing a Partition
Choose a partition \(P\) containing all endpoints:
\[
a, u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, \dots, u_p, v_p, b.
\]
Then:
\[
U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha)
= 	ext{(contribution from discontinuity intervals)} \
+ 	ext{(contribution from continuous intervals)}.
\]

Each part is \(< \epsilon/2\), so:
\[
U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \epsilon.
\]

This proves:
\[
f \in R(\alpha).
\]

## Example
Given:
\[
f(x) = egin{cases}
0, & x 
e x_0, \
1, & x = x_0,
\end{cases}
\]
with \(\alpha\) continuous at \(x_0\).

- On every subinterval except the one containing \(x_0\), \(f=0\).
- On the special interval, infimum is 0 because \(x_0\) is a single point.
- Therefore:
  \[
  L(P,f,\alpha) = 0.
  \]
- Upper sums tend to 0 because \(\alpha\) is continuous at \(x_0\).

So:
\[
\int_a^b f\,d\alpha = 0.
\]

## Summary
- Integrability of \(f\) follows from controlling jumps of the integrator.
- Finitely many discontinuities pose no problem if \(\alpha\) is continuous at those points.
- Partition refinement ensures \(U-L < \epsilon\).
- The technique extends classical Riemann results to RS integrals.
