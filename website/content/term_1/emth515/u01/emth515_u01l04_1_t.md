# U01L04 - Conditions Ensuring Riemann-Stieltjes Integrability (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Recap essential concepts behind Riemann-Stieltjes sums.
- Understand key relations between upper and lower sums and their integrals.
- Review refinement properties.
- Learn strong conditions that guarantee integrability.

## Introduction
This lecture begins with a brief recap of previously established results on Riemann-Stieltjes sums, upper and lower integrals, and the effect of refinement. The discussion then moves to further theorems that support the characterization of Riemann-Stieltjes integrable functions.

## Definitions
- Lower sum:  
  $$L(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta\alpha_i,$$
  where $m_i = \inf f(x)$ on $[x_{i-1},x_i]$.

- Upper sum:  
  $$U(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta\alpha_i,$$
  where $M_i = \sup f(x)$ on $[x_{i-1},x_i]$.

- Lower integral:  
  $$\underline{\int_a^b} f\, d\alpha = \sup_P L(P,f,\alpha).$$

- Upper integral:  
  $$\overline{\int_a^b} f\, d\alpha = \inf_P U(P,f,\alpha).$$

## Main Development

### 1. Review of earlier results
- Always:
  $$
  L(P,f,\alpha) \le U(P,f,\alpha).
  $$

- Lower integral is always less than or equal to upper integral:
  $$
  \underline{\int_a^b} f\, d\alpha \le \overline{\int_a^b} f\, d\alpha.
  $$

- Refinement rule:
  - If $P^*$ refines $P$, then:
    $$
    U(P^*,f,\alpha) \le U(P,f,\alpha), \
    L(P^*,f,\alpha) \ge L(P,f,\alpha).
    $$

- Riemann-Stieltjes integrability condition:
  $$
  f \in R(\alpha) \iff U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \epsilon.
  $$

### 2. Recap of previous theorem
If $f \in R(\alpha)$, then there exists a partition $P$ such that:
$$
| \sum f(t_i)\Delta\alpha_i - \int_a^b f\, d\alpha | < \epsilon.
$$

### 3. Concepts reviewed before new theorems
- $m_i$ is always the infimum of $f$ on each subinterval.
- $M_i$ is always the supremum.
- $\Delta\alpha_i$ is non-negative because $\alpha$ is monotonically increasing.

### 4. Transition to further theorems
The lecture ends by stating that upcoming sessions will include additional theorems and numerical illustrations related to the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

## Summary
- All major relationships between upper sums, lower sums, and integrals were recalled.
- Refinement properties ensure monotonic behavior of sums.
- Integrability is equivalent to squeezing upper and lower sums arbitrarily close.
- This forms the foundation for upcoming theorems and examples.
