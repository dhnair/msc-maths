# U01L03 - Convergence of Sums and Integrability Criteria (Notes)

## Key Points
- Integrability requires upper and lower sums to be arbitrarily close.
- $f \in R(\alpha)$ iff for every $\epsilon>0$ a partition exists with $U(P)-L(P)<\epsilon$.
- Upper integral is the infimum of upper sums; lower integral is the supremum of lower sums.
- Refinements allow both inequalities to be handled simultaneously.

## Definitions and Notation
- $f$: bounded on $[a,b]$.
- $\alpha$: bounded, monotonically increasing on $[a,b]$.
- $P$: partition of $[a,b]$.
- $L(P,f,\alpha)$: lower sum.
- $U(P,f,\alpha)$: upper sum.
- $f \in R(\alpha)$: lower and upper integrals coincide.

## Core Results
- **Theorem:**  
  $$
  f \in R(\alpha) \iff \forall \epsilon>0,\ \exists P:\ U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha)<\epsilon.
  $$

## Important Derivations
- From $f \in R(\alpha)$:  
  - Existence of $P_1$ such that  
    $$U(P_1,f,\alpha) < \int_a^b f\,d\alpha + \epsilon/2.$$
  - Existence of $P_2$ such that  
    $$L(P_2,f,\alpha) > \int_a^b f\,d\alpha - \epsilon/2.$$
  - Refinement $P^*=P_1\cup P_2$ satisfies:  
    $$U(P^*) - L(P^*) < \epsilon.$$

- Converse direction:  
  If $U(P)-L(P)<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$, then upper and lower integrals coincide.

## Relationships and Interpretations
- Common refinement ensures both inequalities hold at once.
- Upper sums approach the integral from above; lower sums approach it from below.
- Convergence of sums characterizes integrability.

## Summary
- Riemann-Stieltjes integrability is equivalent to squeezing upper and lower sums together.
- This criterion is both necessary and sufficient.
