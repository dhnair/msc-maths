# U02L06 - Functions of Bounded Variation (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Relate Riemann–Stieltjes integrability to Riemann integrability via α'.
- Apply mean value theorem to Δα_i.
- Establish equivalence: f ∈ R_α ⇔ f α' ∈ R.
- Understand examples where boundedness does not imply integrability.

## Introduction
This lecture shows that when α has a Riemann–integrable derivative α', the RS integral reduces
to an ordinary Riemann integral with integrand f α'. The lecture also addresses counterexamples
in ordinary Riemann integration.

## Definitions
- α monotonic, α' Riemann integrable.
- Δα_i = α(x_i) − α(x_{i−1}), Δx_i = x_i − x_{i−1}.
- By mean value theorem: Δα_i = α'(t_i) Δx_i.

## Main Development

### 1. Using integrability of α'
Given ε>0, choose partition P such that:
$$
U(α') - L(α') < ε.
$$

Apply mean value theorem on each interval:
$$
\Delta α_i = α'(t_i)\Delta x_i.
$$

### 2. Boundedness of f
Since f bounded ⇒ |f(x)| ≤ K.

Difference between RS sum and Riemann sum:
$$
\left| \sum f(s_i)\Delta α_i - \sum f(s_i)α'(s_i)\Delta x_i ight|
\le K \sum |lpha'(t_i)-α'(s_i)|\Delta x_i.
$$

Bounded above by K(U−L)<Kε.

Thus upper sums satisfy:
$$
U(f,α) < U(f α') + Kε.
$$
Similarly:
$$
U(f α') < U(f,α) + Kε.
$$

Hence:
$$
|U(f,α) - U(f α')| < Kε.
$$

Since partitions can be refined arbitrarily, the lower sums likewise converge.

Conclusion:
- f ∈ R_α ⇔ f α' ∈ R.
- Values satisfy:
$$
\int_a^b f dα = \int_a^b f(x) α'(x) dx.
$$

### 3. Counterexamples
- Bounded does not imply integrable (Dirichlet-type function).
- |f| integrable does not imply f integrable.

Example: f=1 on rationals, −1 on irrationals.
- UP=1, LP=−1 ⇒ not Riemann integrable.
- But |f|=1 integrable.

## Summary
When α has a Riemann-integrable derivative, the RS integral reduces to the ordinary Riemann
integral with integrand f α'. Mean value theorem connects Δα_i to α' Δx_i. The lecture ends with
examples demonstrating limits of classical Riemann integrability.
