# U02L07 - Combining Integrals and Composite Partitions (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the definition of the Riemann–Stieltjes sum.
- Establish the inequalities LP ≤ RS-sum ≤ UP.
- Prove that if limit of RS sums exists as ‖P‖→0, then f ∈ R_α.
- Derive that the limit equals ∫ f dα.
- Apply theory when α' is continuous to show equivalence with ∫ f α' dx.

## Introduction
The lecture formalizes the Riemann–Stieltjes sum and shows that its limit, when it exists under mesh refinement, determines the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. It also shows the connection between the RS sum and the upper and lower sums.

## Definitions
Given:
- f bounded on [a,b].
- α monotonic on [a,b].
- Partition P = {x₀,…,xₙ}.
- Choose tᵢ ∈ [x_{i−1},xᵢ].

Define RS sum:
$$
S_P(f,α) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i)\Delta α_i.
$$

## Main Development

### 1. Bounding the RS Sum
Let mᵢ = inf f on [x_{i−1},xᵢ], Mᵢ = sup f on [x_{i−1},xᵢ].  
Then:
$$
m_i \le f(t_i) \le M_i.
$$
Multiply by Δαᵢ and sum:
$$
LP(f,α) \le S_P(f,α) \le UP(f,α).
$$

### 2. Convergence Criterion
If the limit:
$$
\lim_{\|P\|	o 0} S_P(f,α)=A
$$
exists, then for ε>0 choose δ>0 such that ‖P‖<δ ⇒ |S_P(f,α)−A|<ε/4.

Use bounds on mᵢ,Mᵢ and the total variation Δα to show:
$$
UP(f,α)-LP(f,α)<ε.
$$
Thus f ∈ R_α.

### 3. Equality of Limit and Integral
Since:
$$
LP(f,α) \le S_P(f,α) \le UP(f,α),
$$
and both upper and lower integrals converge to A, we obtain:
$$
\int_a^b f dα = A.
$$

### 4. Smooth α: RS integral equals Riemann integral
If α' continuous:
Δαᵢ = α'(tᵢ)Δxᵢ.  
Then:
$$
S_P(f,α)=\sum f(t_i)lpha'(t_i)\Delta x_i.
$$
Hence:
$$
\int_a^b f dα = \int_a^b f α' dx.
$$

## Summary
The RS sum lies between LP and UP. If its limit exists under mesh refinement, f is RS-integrable and the limit equals the RS integral. When α has a continuous derivative, the RS integral coincides with the ordinary Riemann integral of f α'.
