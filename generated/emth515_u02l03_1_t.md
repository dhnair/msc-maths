# U02L03 - Additivity and Linearity of the Integral (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand conditions under which f belongs to R_{alpha1+alpha2}.
- Derive linearity: ∫ f d(alpha1+alpha2) = ∫ f d alpha1 + ∫ f d alpha2.
- Understand integrability with respect to c alpha.

### Introduction
This lecture establishes additivity of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral with respect to the integrator and scalar multiplication of the integrator.

### Definitions
Given f ∈ R_{alpha1} and f ∈ R_{alpha2}, the goal is to show f ∈ R_{alpha1+alpha2}.

### Main Development
We begin with partitions P1 and P2 such that:
- UP1(f,alpha1) - LP1(f,alpha1) < ε/2
- UP2(f,alpha2) - LP2(f,alpha2) < ε/2

Let P = P1 ∪ P2.  
Then both inequalities hold for P as well.

Compute upper sum with respect to alpha = alpha1 + alpha2:
$$
UP(f,alpha) = \sum M_i (alpha1(x_i)-alpha1(x_{i-1}) + alpha2(x_i)-alpha2(x_{i-1}))
$$
which splits as:
$$
UP(f,alpha1) + UP(f,alpha2)
$$

Similarly:
$$
LP(f,alpha) = LP(f,alpha1) + LP(f,alpha2)
$$

Hence:
$$
UP(f,alpha) - LP(f,alpha) = (UP(f,alpha1)-LP(f,alpha1)) + (UP(f,alpha2)-LP(f,alpha2)) < ε.
$$
Thus f ∈ R_{alpha1+alpha2}.

### Linearity of the Integral
Using upper and lower sums inequality chains one obtains:
$$
\int_a^b f d(alpha1+alpha2) = \int_a^b f d alpha1 + \int_a^b f d alpha2.
$$

### Integrability with Respect to c alpha
For c>0:
- Δ(c alpha)_i = c Δ alpha_i
- UP(f,c alpha) = c UP(f,alpha)
- LP(f,c alpha) = c LP(f,alpha)

Thus f ∈ R_{c alpha} and:
$$
\int_a^b f d(c alpha) = c \int_a^b f d alpha.
$$
