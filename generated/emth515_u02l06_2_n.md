# U02L06 - Functions of Bounded Variation (Notes)

## Key Points
- If α' exists and is Riemann integrable, RS integral reduces to Riemann integral.
- f ∈ R_α ⇔ f α' ∈ R.
- Δα_i = α'(t_i)Δx_i via mean value theorem.

## Definitions and Notation
- α monotonic with Riemann-integrable derivative α'.
- Δα_i = α(x_i)-α(x_{i−1}), Δx_i = x_i−x_{i−1}.

## Core Results
- Difference between RS sums and Riemann sums bounded by K(U−L).
- Therefore f ∈ R_α iff f α' ∈ R.
- Integral identity:
$$
\int_a^b f dα = \int_a^b fα' dx.
$$

## Important Derivations
- Apply Lagrange MVT on each subinterval.
- Use bounds on α' to control errors.
- Compare U(f,α) with U(f α').

## Relationships
- RS integral generalizes Riemann integral; equality holds when α smooth enough.

## Summary
Integrability with respect to α reduces to classical Riemann integrability when α' exists and is integrable. Counterexamples illustrate the limits of ordinary Riemann theory.
