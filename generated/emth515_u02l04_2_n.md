# U02L04 - Refinement-Based Characterizations (Notes)

## Key Points
- Finite discontinuities do not prevent RS-integrability.
- α must be continuous at each discontinuity of f.
- Partition built to isolate discontinuity intervals.

## Definitions
- E = finite set of discontinuities.
- (ui,vi): disjoint intervals containing each yi ∈ E.

## Core Results
- If f bounded, finitely discontinuous and α continuous at those points → f ∈ R_alpha.
- ∑(α(vi)-α(ui)) small ensures discontinuity contribution < ε/2.
- f continuous on remaining intervals ⇒ integrable there.

## Important Derivations
- Upper–lower sum split into discontinuity intervals and continuous intervals.
- Continuous parts contribute < ε/2.
- Discontinuity intervals bounded via uniform α-smallness.

## Relationships
- Shows robustness of RS integral under finite discontinuities.
- Basis for evaluating integrals with step-type α.

## Summary
Integrability holds when discontinuities of f are controlled and α is continuous at those points.
