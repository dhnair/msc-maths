## Learning Outcomes
- Apply unit-step based integrators in Riemann–Stieltjes integration.
- Evaluate ∫ f dα where α is a weighted sum of jumps.
- Understand convergence conditions for α(x) = ∑ c_n I(x - s_n).
- Use continuity of f to compute the integral as a weighted sum of point values.
- Understand the change of variables theorem for Riemann–Stieltjes integrals.

## Introduction
This lecture develops integrals with respect to integrators formed by infinite sums of weighted unit-step functions. Under convergence assumptions on coefficients and continuity of f, the integral becomes a series of weighted point evaluations. The lecture concludes with the change-of-variables theorem.

## Definitions
- Unit-step: I(x-s) = 0 if x ≤ s, and 1 if x > s.
- α(x) = ∑ c_n I(x - s_n), with c_n ≥ 0 and ∑ c_n convergent.
- f continuous on [a,b].

## Main Development

### 1. Convergence of α
Since I(x - s_n) ≤ 1 and c_n ≥ 0,  
$$
c_n I(x-s_n) \le c_n.
$$
Because ∑ c_n converges, comparison shows α(x) = ∑ c_n I(x-s_n) convergent for each x.  
Monotonicity follows from monotonicity of each unit step.

### 2. Splitting α into finite and tail parts
Given ε>0 choose M such that  
$$
\sum_{n=M+1}^{\infty} c_n < ε.
$$
Define:
- α₁(x) = ∑_{n=1}^M c_n I(x-s_n)
- α₂(x) = ∑_{n=M+1}^\infty c_n I(x-s_n)

Then α = α₁ + α₂.

### 3. Evaluating ∫ f dα₁
Since α₁ is a finite sum of jumps located at s₁,…,s_M and f is continuous at these points:
$$
\int_a^b f dα₁ = \sum_{n=1}^M c_n f(s_n).
$$

### 4. Bounding ∫ f dα₂
Because f bounded ⇒ |f(x)| ≤ K:
$$
\left| \int_a^b f dα₂ ight| \le K(α₂(b)-α₂(a)).
$$
But α₂(b)-α₂(a) = ∑_{n=M+1}^{\infty} c_n < ε.

Thus |∫ f dα₂| ≤ K ε.

Letting M→∞ gives:
$$
\int_a^b f dα = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n f(s_n).
$$

### 5. Change of Variables Theorem
Given:
- φ: [A,B]→[a,b] strictly increasing, continuous.
- α monotonic on [a,b].
- β(y)=α(φ(y)).
- g(y)=f(φ(y)).

Corresponding partitions satisfy φ(y_i)=x_i.  
Upper and lower sums transform identically:
$$
L_Q(g,β)=L_P(f,α), \quad U_Q(g,β)=U_P(f,α).
$$
Hence:
$$
\int_A^B g dβ = \int_a^b f dα.
$$

## Summary
The lecture proves that RS integrators built from convergent weighted sums of jump functions yield integrals equal to weighted sums of function values at jump points. Continuity of f ensures correct evaluation at each jump. The lecture concludes by establishing the general change-of-variables formula, showing that integrals transform naturally under strictly increasing continuous substitutions.
