# U02L04 - Refinement-Based Characterizations (Transcript)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand integrability when f has finitely many discontinuities.
- Use covering intervals and partition construction.
- Apply theorem to special functions including characteristic and unit-step cases.

## Introduction
The lecture proves that if f has finitely many discontinuities and alpha is continuous at those points, then f ∈ R_alpha.

## Definitions
- E = {y1,...,yp}: finite discontinuity set.
- Cover each yi with (ui,vi) such that yi is interior point.
- α continuous at yi ensures α(vi)-α(ui) small.

## Main Development
1. f bounded ⇒ m ≤ f ≤ M on [a,b].
2. Choose intervals (ui,vi) so that:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^p (lpha(vi)-lpha(ui)) < rac{\epsilon}{2(M-m)}.
$$
3. On remaining p+1 intervals f is continuous ⇒ f ∈ R_alpha on each.
4. Construct partition P containing all ui,vi but no interior points of (ui,vi).
5. Upper–lower sum difference bounded by:
$$
\sum (M_i-m_i)\Delta lpha_i + \sum rac{\epsilon}{2(p+1)} < \epsilon.
$$
Thus f ∈ R_alpha.

### Application: single-point discontinuity
If f(x)=0 except f(x0)=1 and α continuous at x0:
- m_i=0 ⇒ LP=0 ⇒ integral = 0.

### Unit-step function case
α(x)=I(x-s).  
Then ∫ f dα = f(s) if f continuous at s.
