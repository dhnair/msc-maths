# ðŸ§® M.Sc Mathematics â€“ Notes and Transcripts

Welcome to **Deepak Nairâ€™s MSc Mathematics Knowledge Vault**,  
a structured collection of **transcripts, study notes, and references** for the entire program.

This repository is designed to be:
- **Pedagogical** â€“ Each transcript is self-contained and explanatory.  
- **Linked** â€“ Concepts cross-reference across subjects.  
- **Obsidian-compatible** â€“ Notes are Markdown + LaTeX ready.  
- **Publishable** â€“ Rendered using MkDocs Material for web access.

## ðŸ“š About This Project
These notes are based on the M.Sc Mathematics curriculum and organized term-wise, covering both **core** and **applied** branches of mathematics.

Every unit includes:
- **Full Transcripts** â€“ Detailed derivations, proofs, and examples.  
- **Quick Study Notes** â€“ Concise revision-oriented summaries.  
- **Reference Sheets** â€“ Common symbols, theorems, and formatting standards.  

> _Goal: To transform learning into a living, open, version-controlled knowledge base._
