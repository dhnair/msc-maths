# 🧮 M.Sc Mathematics – Notes and Transcripts

Welcome to **Deepak Nair’s MSc Mathematics Knowledge Vault**,  
a structured collection of **transcripts, study notes, and references** for the entire program.

This repository is designed to be:
- **Pedagogical** – Each transcript is self-contained and explanatory.  
- **Linked** – Concepts cross-reference across subjects.  
- **Obsidian-compatible** – Notes are Markdown + LaTeX ready.  
- **Publishable** – Rendered using MkDocs Material for web access.

## 📚 About This Project
These notes are based on the M.Sc Mathematics curriculum and organized term-wise, covering both **core** and **applied** branches of mathematics.

Every unit includes:
- **Full Transcripts** – Detailed derivations, proofs, and examples.  
- **Quick Study Notes** – Concise revision-oriented summaries.  
- **Reference Sheets** – Common symbols, theorems, and formatting standards.  

> _Goal: To transform learning into a living, open, version-controlled knowledge base._

## ✨ Vision
> “Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms:  
> it’s about understanding.”  
> — William Paul Thurston

These notes aim to promote that understanding — grounded, structured, and open.
